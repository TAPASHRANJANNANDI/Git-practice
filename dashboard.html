    </header>
    <article>
    <p>Good health is the foundation of a happy and fulfilling life. It enables us to perform daily activities with energy and enthusiasm, and it helps prevent a wide range of diseases and health conditions.</p>
    
    <h2>Healthy Eating</h2>
    <p>Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins provides the essential nutrients our bodies need. Avoiding excessive sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats can reduce the risk of chronic illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes.</p>
    
    <h2>Regular Exercise</h2>
    <p>Physical activity strengthens the heart, muscles, and bones, improves mental health, and boosts the immune system. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, such as walking, cycling, or swimming.</p>
    
    <h2>Mental Well-being</h2>
    <p>Mental health is just as important as physical health. Practices such as mindfulness, meditation, and maintaining social connections can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being.</p>
    
    <h2>Regular Check-ups</h2>
    <p>Visiting healthcare professionals for regular check-ups and screenings can help detect potential health issues early, making treatment more effective.</p>
    
    <h2>Quality Sleep</h2>
    <p>Getting enough restful sleep is crucial for physical and mental health. Adults should aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to support cognitive function, mood regulation, and overall wellness.</p>
    
    <h2>Hydration</h2>
    <p>Drinking enough water throughout the day helps maintain bodily functions, supports digestion, and keeps skin healthy. Aim for at least 8 glasses of water daily, adjusting for activity level and climate.</p>
    
    <h2>Stress Management</h2>
    <p>Chronic stress can negatively impact health. Techniques such as deep breathing, yoga, and spending time in nature can help manage stress and promote relaxation.</p>

    <h2>Avoiding Harmful Substances</h2>
    <p>Limiting or avoiding alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drug use is essential for long-term health. These substances can increase the risk of numerous diseases, including cancer and liver damage.</p>

    <h2>Personal Hygiene</h2>
    <p>Maintaining good hygiene, such as regular handwashing, dental care, and bathing, helps prevent infections and contributes to overall well-being.</p>

    <h2>Sun Protection</h2>
    <p>Protecting the skin from harmful UV rays by using sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding peak sunlight hours can prevent skin damage and reduce the risk of skin cancer.</p>

    <h2>Health Education</h2>
    <p>Staying informed about health-related topics and being proactive about learning healthy habits empowers individuals to make better lifestyle choices.</p>

    <h2>Good Posture</h2>
    <p>Maintaining proper posture, especially when sitting for long periods, helps prevent back and neck pain. Ergonomic furniture and regular breaks from sitting can support spinal health.</p>

    <h2>Digital Well-being</h2>
    <p>Managing screen time, using blue light filters, and taking regular breaks from digital devices can reduce eye strain and promote better sleep and mental focus.</p>

    <h2>Environmental Wellness</h2>
    <p>Living in a clean and safe environment contributes to overall health. Reducing pollution, minimizing exposure to toxins, and ensuring proper ventilation in homes and workplaces are essential.</p>

    <h2>Work-Life Balance</h2>
    <p>Balancing work responsibilities with personal time helps reduce burnout and enhances overall happiness and productivity. Setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care is key.</p>

    <h2>Social Connections</h2>
    <p>Maintaining strong relationships with family, friends, and community members boosts emotional health, provides support, and encourages a sense of belonging.</p>

    <h2>Volunteering and Community Involvement</h2>
    <p>Participating in community service or charitable activities can improve mood, reduce stress, and provide a sense of purpose and connection to society.</p>
